name: remember
description: "Optional manual note on a target or the last confirmed finding. Capture is automatic during autopilot; this is for extra context. Usage: /remember"
---

# /remember

> **Capture is automatic.** During an engine/autopilot run, every confirmed finding is
> written to the ledger (`~/.claude/bughunter/memory/findings.jsonl`) with no action from you.
> `/remember` is only for adding an **optional manual note** — a technique detail or
> follow-up idea — that the automatic capture would not include.

## Usage

```
/remember   # then describe the note; it is appended to the target's rollup
```

## What It Is Not

This is no longer the primary way findings enter memory — the engine captures those
deterministically. Use it sparingly for human context.
